"""Environment classes for robot simulation and planning execution.

This module provides the recommended interface for robot environments
used in PDDL planning and simulation.

Usage:
    from railroad.environment import (
        Environment,           # Abstract base class for environments
        SymbolicEnvironment,   # Environment for symbolic execution
        ActiveSkill,           # Protocol for skill execution
        SymbolicSkill,         # Symbolic skill implementation
    )

Legacy classes have been moved to railroad.experimental.environment:
    from railroad.experimental.environment import (
        AbstractEnvironment, BaseEnvironment, SimpleEnvironment,
        EnvironmentInterface, OngoingAction, SkillStatus, SimulatedRobot, Pose,
    )

Unknown-space frontier search lives in railroad.experimental.unknown_search.
