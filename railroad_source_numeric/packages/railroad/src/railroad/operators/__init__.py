"""Operator constructors for PDDL planning.

This module provides operator constructors for common robot planning actions.
All operators are re-exported here for convenient imports.

Usage:
    from railroad.operators import construct_move_operator, construct_pick_operator

Naming convention:
- Default operators (without suffix) are non-blocking
- `_blocking` suffix indicates operators with just-moved/just-picked/just-placed preconditions
- `_constrained` suffix indicates operators with additional constraints

Available operators:
- Movement: construct_move_operator, construct_move_operator_blocking,
            construct_move_visited_operator, construct_move_visited_operator_constrained
- Search: construct_search_operator, construct_search_and_pick_operator
- Pick: construct_pick_operator, construct_pick_operator_blocking
- Place: construct_place_operator, construct_place_operator_blocking
- Wait: construct_wait_operator, construct_no_op_operator

Navigation/frontier operators are in
``railroad.experimental.unknown_search.operators``.
