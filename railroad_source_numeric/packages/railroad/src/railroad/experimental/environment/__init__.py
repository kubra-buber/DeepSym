"""Legacy environment classes for robot simulation and planning execution.

This module contains the original environment interface that has been superseded
by the newer Environment/ActiveSkill architecture in railroad.environment.

For new code, prefer using:
- railroad.environment.Environment (abstract base class)
- railroad.environment.SymbolicEnvironment (concrete implementation)
- railroad.environment.ActiveSkill (protocol)
- railroad.environment.SymbolicSkill

This legacy interface is preserved for backward compatibility.
