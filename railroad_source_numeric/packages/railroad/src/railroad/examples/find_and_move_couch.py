"""Find and Move Couch Task.

This example demonstrates:
1. OR goals - satisfying one of several possible conditions
2. Multi-robot coordination with search and transport
3. Complex goal expressions using the fluent operator syntax

The goal is to move either a Remote OR Plate to the den, AND either a Cookie
OR Couch to the den. This shows how OR goals allow flexibility in achieving
objectives.
