"""Clear the Table Task.

This example demonstrates a "none" goal type where the objective is to ensure
NO objects remain on a table. The goal is expressed as an AND of negated literals:
for each object that starts on the table, the goal requires NOT(at object table).

This tests the goal system's handling of negated fluents in goals, which is useful
for scenarios where the desired state is the absence of certain predicates rather
than their presence.
