"""Heterogeneous Robots Search and Deliver Task.

This example demonstrates multi-robot planning with heterogeneous robot capabilities:
1. Different robot types (rover, crawler, drone) with different abilities
2. Drone can only search (and move), while rover and crawler can also pick/place
3. Drone moves faster than ground robots
4. Robots must search locations to find supplies and deliver them to base

The heterogeneous capabilities require the planner to reason about which robot
can perform which actions, leading to interesting coordination strategies.
