"""
Multi-Object Search and Place Task

This script demonstrates a more complex planning scenario where a robot must:
1. Search for multiple objects scattered across different locations
2. Handle missing objects (some searches will fail)
3. Pick up found objects and transport them to target locations
4. Place objects at their designated spots

The environment simulates a household with multiple rooms where items are
disorganized and some items are missing entirely.

Uses the new Goal API for defining planning objectives.
